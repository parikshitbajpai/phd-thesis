As of May 2018, all theses and dissertations are required to have a Statement of Contributions, which appears immediately before the Table of Contents. The Statement of Contributions must indicate the unique contributions of the author in the context of collaborative research that may have involved others who worked on various parts of the research described in the thesis. Types or contributions can include identification and design of the research project, performance of various parts of the research, and data analysis. In addition, if any parts of the thesis research have been published as an article, or is under consideration for publication, then the publication information must also be included here. 

\textbf{Example 1}

The work described in Chapter 4 was performed at the Futuristic Automotive Research Centre of Excellence (FARCE) in Hill Valley, California, using the Flux Capacitor testing laboratory operated by Dr. Emmett Brown. I was responsible for installing and testing flux capacitors in my automotive prototype vehicles.

\textbf{Example 2}

Part of the work described in Chapter 5 has been published as:

J.T.S. Allan, L.E. Prest, E.B. Easton, “The sulfonation of polyvinyl chloride: Synthesis and characterization for proton conducting membrane applications”, Journal of Membrane Science, 489 (2015) 175-182. doi: 10.1016/j.memsci.2015.03.093. 

I performed the majority of the synthesis, testing of membrane materials, and writing of the manuscript.
