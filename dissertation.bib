	abstract = {A number of codes are used to predict various aspects of nuclear fuel performance and safety, ranging from conventional fuel performance codes to simulate normal operating conditions to integral engineering codes to simulate severe accident behaviour. There has been a number of reportings in the open literature of nuclear fuel codes being informed by thermodynamic calculations, ranging from the use of simple thermodynamic correlations to direct coupling of equilibrium thermodynamic software. Progress in expanding predictive capabilities have been reported, which also includes advances in thermodynamic database development to better capture irradiated fuel. However, this progress has been accompanied by several challenges, including effective coupling of different types of physical phenomena in a practical manner and doing so with a reasonable increase in computational expense. This review paper will summarize previous experiences reported in the open literature in coupling thermodynamic calculations with nuclear fuel codes and applications, identify current challenges and limitations, and offer some perspectives for the community to consider moving forward.},

	abstract = {Pellet-Clad Interaction (PCI) in zirconium alloy cladding has been a long-standing concern in the context of nuclear fuel reliability. Mitigation measures have constrained operational limits in combination with modifying the manufacturing process of the cladding, such as adding a composite layer or a protective coating to the inner surface of the cladding. The foregoing remedies have satisfactorily resolved the problem at the expense of restricted operational performance (i.e., maximum power, power ramp limits and burnup) that limit potential revenue in operation. With the continuing interest in extending performance limits of conventional nuclear fuels and consideration of new fuel designs, current mitigation measures may become less effective, necessitating research efforts to develop new solutions. The objective of this review is to present the current state of understanding of the PCI phenomenon, outline current mitigation strategies, and discuss advancements in experimental and computational techniques to further elucidate the problem. The ultimate goal is to develop a sound scientific understanding of the PCI phenomenon to improve engineering solutions and optimize operational parameters to enhance performance while maintaining a high level of reliability and safety.},

	abstract = {The Thermodynamics of Advanced Fuels -- International Database (TAF-ID) was developed using the Calphad method to provide a computational tool to perform thermodynamic calculations on nuclear fuel materials under normal and off-normal conditions. Different kinds of fuels are considered: oxide, metallic, carbide and nitride fuels. Many fission products are introduced as well as structural materials (e.g., zirconium, steel, concrete, SiC) and absorbers (e.g., B4C), in order to investigate the thermochemistry of irradiated fuels and to predict their chemical interaction with the surrounding materials. The approach to develop the database and the models implemented in the database are described. Examples of models for key chemical systems are presented. Finally, a few examples of application calculations on severe accidents with UO2 fuels, irradiated fuel chemistry of MOX and metallic fuels and metallic fuel/cladding interaction show how this tool can be used. To validate the database, the calculations are compared to the available experimental data. A good agreement is obtained which gives confidence in the maturity degree and quality of the TAF-ID database. The working version is only accessible to the participants of the TAF-ID project (Canada, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Republic of Korea, United Kingdom, USA). A public version is accessible by all the NEA countries. The current version contains models on the Am--Fe, Am--Np, Am-O-Pu, Am--U, Am--Zr, C--O--U-Pu, Cr--U, Np--U, Np--Zr, O--U--Zr, Re--U, Ru--U, Si--U, Ti--U, U-Pu-Zr, U--W systems.

Two cases have been explored in this work: Case I) the fuel is in contact with varying combinations of hydrogen and steam (i.e., mainly reducing), and Case II) the fuel is in contact with varying combinations of air and steam (i.e., oxidizing). The system thermochemistry has been computed for a wide range of gas mixtures for both cases, fuel to gas ratios, temperatures, and hydrostatic pressures. The calculations predict fission gas speciation and fuel volatilization based on equilibrium thermodynamics, including the formation of several secondary phases, changes in UO2$\pm$x stoichiometry, fission product solubility in various phases, melting, and vaporization. The overall objective of this work was to inform source term analyses in the industry standard toolset SOURCE under severe accident conditions of a CANDU station.},

	abstract = {In the context of the recent developments in the field of high entropy alloys (HEAs), CrFeNi based alloys with the addition of Al have gained significant attention due to their interesting combination of mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, enabling an even wider range of applications for HEAs. A key feature of this system is the co-existence of multiple phases such as body centered cubic (BCC) and face centered cubic (FCC) phase, which significantly enhances the mechanical performance of the alloy. However, despite the ongoing research efforts, an in-depth study of the effect of Al on the phase transformation kinetics in this system is not yet available, which undermines the design of effective heat treatments, curbing the optimization of microstructures and properties. In this work, the influence of 5 at.{\%}Al addition on the interdiffusion behavior and phase transformation kinetics from FCC to BCC phase at 700 $\,^{\circ}$C is studied by experiments and state-of-the-art phase field simulations. The kinetics of BCC precipitation are observed experimentally through the sequential characterization of samples heat treated up to 11 days. 2D phase field (PF) simulations of the growth and coarsening of BCC-precipitates in a dual-phase BCC/FCC system are performed on the same alloy system. Experimental observations reveal that the growth of BCC is greatly enhanced by the addition of Al to the ternary CrFeNi system. This result is consistent with findings from the phase field simulation. PF results show that the gradients of the diffusion potentials and interdiffusion mobilities are increased in the case of Al addition, which explains the significant increase of the phase transformation rate from FCC to BCC. Finally, the cross terms in multi-component diffusion equations are found to significantly affect the evolution of the phases. These findings demonstrate the need of multicomponent models to fully understand the complex interdiffusion behavior in high and medium entropy alloys to foster the design of these materials.},

	abstract = {Intermetallic phase-based alloys, in particular transition-metal aluminides, are potential structural and coating materials for high-temperature applications. Such applications usually involve interdiffusion between two dissimilar materials. To simulate interdiffusion microstructures quantitatively, it becomes essential to solve alloy phase-field models in conjunction with multicomponent CALPHAD databases. This coupling, however, still remains a challenge when considering binary or multicomponent intermetallic phases. Here, a novel method that incorporates successfully diffusion potential dependent-properties of bulk multicomponent phases into a grand-potential based multi-phase-field model is proposed. It uses phase-specific properties directly precomputed from CALPHAD-type databases as discrete functions of solute diffusion potentials. Six different alloy cases, ranging from a five-phase binary (Ni-Al) to a two-phase quaternary (Al-Cr-Ni-Fe) alloy, are simulated to illustrate the application and correctness of the method. The cases include both substitutional and intermetallic phases. Where a comparison is possible, the simulations show good agreement with DICTRA and experimental results, thus validating our proposed method. In contrast to our approach, we find that DICTRA fails in three of the simulations involving ordered intermetallics. We further show that the interface width in this model can be varied without accuracy loss, thus enabling computationally affordable simulations at experimentally comparable length and time scales.},

Its occurrence can drastically alter the composition landscape and lead to patterns, either beneficial or undesired to the alloy design. This phenomenon is reported commonly in the BCC phase region of AlCoCrFeNi high-entropy alloys and their cost-effective Co-free alternatives based on AlCrFeNi due to chemical ordering. To better understand this transformation, we employ a phase-field model with materials parameters obtained from the CALPHAD methodology.

The relation between the site fraction variables in the CALPHAD sublattice model and the mole fractions in the phase-field equations is provided via neural networks. The acquisition of training data on the equilibrium value of the site fractions is presented along with the training and validation procedure. The trained neural networks are combined with a finite-element framework and Cahn--Hilliard model to simulate the BCC-B2 phase separation at different compositions.},

	abstract = {A new approach to incorporate the sublattice models in the CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagram) formalism directly into the phase-field formalism is developed. In binary alloys, the sublattice models can be classified into two types (i.e., ``Type I'' and ``Type II''), depending on whether a direct one-to-one relation between the element site fraction in the CALPHAD database and the phase concentration in the phase-field model exists (Type I), or not (Type II). For ``Type II'' sublattice models, the specific site fractions, corresponding to a given mole fraction, have to be established via internal relaxation between different sublattices. Internal minimization of sublattice occupancy and solute evolution during microstructure transformation leads, in general, to a solution superior to the separate solution of the individual problems. The present coupling technique is validated for Fe--C and Ni--Al alloys. Finally, the model is extended into multicomponent alloys and applied to simulate the nucleation process of VC monocarbide from austenite matrix in a steel containing vanadium.},

	abstract = {A novel Calphad coupled mechano-chemical phase-field model is presented which in addition to chemo-elastic contributions to the driving force further includes mechano-chemical effects on diffusion (stress-driven diffusion), equilibrium compositions and driving force. These effects have their origin in the concentration dependency of the eigenstrains and can significantly influence the phase transformation kinetics, especially in Ni-based superalloys where the different dissolved elements have strongly different partial molar volumes. In this paper, all mechano-chemical contributions to diffusion, equilibrium concentrations and driving force are derived starting from a free energy functional. In order to use the model in conjunction with Calphad databases, elastic effects are incorporated in an efficient and consistent way by a posteriori treatment of the chemical quasi-equilibrium data. The new model is first applied to evaluate the 3D-equilibrium shape of a single γ'-particle in a binary Ni-Al and a ternary Ni-Al-Mo alloy and then for the simulation of Ostwald ripening and rafting of the multicomponent CMSX-4 alloy. Results from simulations with and without consideration of the mechano-chemical contributions are compared. It is shown that, especially in case of the ternary and multicomponent alloys, the mechano-chemical effects on the equilibrium shapes of the γ'-particles and on interface kinetics are considerable and cannot be neglected. Moreover, different standard homogenization assumptions for stresses and strains inside the diffuse interface region (Voigt-Taylor, Khachaturyan, Reuss-Sachs) have been systematically compared and analyzed using an extended quasi-equilibrium approach, leading to a new evaluation of their applicability in the context of mechano-chemical coupling.},

In quantitative modeling the assessment and compilation of thermodynamic/kinetic data is largely dominated by the CALPHAD approach, which has produced a large set of experimentally and computationally generated Gibbs free energy and atomic mobility data in a standardized format: the thermodynamic database (TDB) file format. Harnessing this data for the purpose of phase-field modeling is an ongoing effort encompassing a wide variety of approaches. In this paper, we aim to directly link CALPHAD data to the phase-field method, without intermediate fitting or interpolation steps. We introduce a model based on the Kim-Kim-Suzuki (KKS) approach. This model includes sublattice site fractions and can directly utilize data from TDB files. Using this approach, we demonstrate the model on the U-Zr and Mo-Ni-Re systems.},

	abstract = {We present a novel phase-field model development capability in the open source MOOSE finite element framework. This facility is based on the ``modular free energy'' approach in which the phase-field equations are implemented in a general form that is logically separated from model-specific data such as the thermodynamic free energy density and mobility functions. Free energy terms contributing to a phase-field model are abstracted into self-contained objects that can be dynamically combined at simulation run time. Combining multiple chemical and mechanical free energy contributions expedites the construction of coupled phase-field, mechanics, and multiphase models. This approach allows computational material scientists to focus on implementing new material models, and to reuse existing solution algorithms and data processing routines. A key new aspect of the rapid phase-field development approach that we discuss in detail is the automatic symbolic differentiation capability. Automatic symbolic differentiation is used to compute derivatives of the free energy density functionals, and removes potential sources of human error while guaranteeing that the nonlinear system Jacobians are accurately approximated. Through just-in-time compilation, we greatly reduce the computational expense of evaluating the differentiated expressions. The new capability is demonstrated for a variety of representative applications.},

	abstract = {A mechanistic-based mass accountancy model in the context of liquid-fueled molten salt reactors was implemented in the dynamic systems modeling software library TRANSFORM by way of coupling with the equilibrium thermodynamics code Thermochimica. Liquid-fueled molten salt reactors present new challenges for mass accountancy because of the dissolution of fuel and evolved fission products, which may be soluble in the salt, off-gas, or precipitate. Two cases of mass loss from the molten salt were addressed: off-gassing and precipitation. The software implementation was tested through a series of increasingly complex demonstration problems, culminating in a model of the primary fuel and primary coolant loops of the molten salt demonstration reactor. Analysis shows that negligible mass was lost from the salt under normal operating conditions, but an overheating event caused by partial loss of fuel loop cooling resulted in release of measurable amounts of uranium (among other elements) via off-gassing. The tools developed here are primarily aimed at capability development but are readily available for use in further modeling of molten salt reactor concepts. These tools have not yet been validated, and future experimental work to perform this validation is recommended.},

@article{Introini:2020aa,
	abstract = {In this paper, a robust, accurate and efficient coupling between the PLEIADES/ALCYONE 2.1 fuel performance code and the OpenCalphad thermo-chemical solver is presented. A challenging 3.5D simulation of a power ramp, consisting of the 3D simulations of all the fuel pellets within a complete rodlet, serves as a base case to illustrate the difficulty inherent to extensive thermochemical equilibrium calculations (more than 1.5 million in this example) within fuel performance simulations, related both to the wide temperature and pressure range encountered in irradiated nuclear fuels. In the first part of this paper, a detailed analysis of the main quantities of interest (i.e. temperature, hydrostatic pressure, fission products concentration) is provided to illustrate the couplings at hand during a power ramp and, above all, to demonstrate the good agreement of the results with those already published in the literature and with available measurements of xenon, c{\ae}sium and iodine releases. In the core of this paper, several numerical strategies are proposed to reduce the overall time spent in the thermochemical solver by defining at each node and for each time step a good initial estimate of the set of stable phases that are likely to form. The first one, referred to as the spatial strategy, relies on an intelligent reorganization of the mesh nodes as a function of temperature or hydrostatic pressure with an appropriate initialization of the thermochemical equilibrium calculation at a node by the phase composition calculated at the node with the closest thermo-mechanical conditions. The second strategy, referred to as the hybrid strategy, combines the spatial strategy during the power transient (where large power variations take place at each time step) with an initialization of the nodal equilibria from the solution obtained at the previous time step in case of small power variations. The 3.5D simulation has been run several times in order to assess and compare the spatial and hybrid strategies. The simulations show that the spatial strategy is the most efficient. It leads to an overall increase of the calculation time related to the incorporation of thermochemistry in the 3.5D fuel performance simulation of less than 2.25%, showing the feasibility of large thermal-chemical--mechanical simulations within the PLEIADES/ALCYONE 2.1 fuel performance code. Finally, as a first step towards more complicated simulations (i.e. including a greater number of phases and/or performed with a finer spatial discretization), a primitive parallelization algorithm based on a multiprocess approach is proposed. Combined with the most efficient spatial strategy, it leads to a substantial reduction of the extra (real) calculation time related to thermochemistry which become less than 0.65% of the total computation time when the thermochemical equilibrium calculations are distributed over 4 cores.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors (MSRs) utilize salts as coolant or as the fuel and coolant together with fissile isotopes dissolved in the salt. It is necessary to therefore understand the behavior of the salts to effectively design, operate, and regulate such reactors, and thus there is a need for thermodynamic models for the salt systems. Molten salts, however, are difficult to represent as they exhibit short-range order that is dependent on both composition and temperature. A widely useful approach is the modified quasichemical model in the quadruplet approximation that provides for consideration of first- and second-nearest-neighbor coordination and interactions. Its use in the CALPHAD approach to system modeling requires fitting parameters using standard thermodynamic data such as phase equilibria, heat capacity, and others. A shortcoming of the model is its inability to directly vary coordination numbers with composition or temperature. Another issue is the difficulty in fitting model parameters using regression methods without already having very good initial values. The proposed paper will discuss these issues and note some practical methods for the effective generation of useful models.},

	abstract = {Molten salts have long been considered as primary coolants and heat transfer media for nuclear energy systems because of their high boiling points, volumetric heat capacities, and thermal conductivities. The high solubility of fission products in molten salts provides a greater safety margin in molten salt-based reactor concepts that employ either homogeneous molten salt fluid fuel or encapsulated fuel particles immersed in a molten salt. This chapter focuses primarily on fluoride salts, but also on chloride and fluoroborate salts based on the preponderance of interest that these salts have received for nuclear energy systems. These molten salts can be quite corrosive at high temperatures with corrosion being driven by thermodynamics, impurity effects, and activity and temperature gradients. Understanding and mitigating materials corrosion in these molten salt environments by appropriate materials selection and salt chemistry control are necessary for their effective implementation in nuclear energy systems.},

A few strategies are presented to quantify corrosion rates of Ni-based materials isothermally exposed in purified KCl-MgCl2 salts at 600 ∘ C-800 ∘ C. The influence of capsule material, potential corrosion products and role of alloy composition on the observed corrosion rates was discussed with coupled thermodynamic-kinetic models. Larger depths of corrosion attack were observed in alloy 230 specimens compared to other alloys under similar conditions was attributed to the much higher chemical activity of Cr in the alloy that results in a larger Cr chemical potential gradient.},

Radiation damage usually leads to detrimental effects such as embrittlement, accelerated creep, phase instability, and radiation-altered corrosion. Here we report that proton irradiation decelerates intergranular corrosion of Ni-Cr alloys in molten fluoride salt at 650 $\,^{\circ}$C. We demonstrate this by showing that the depth of intergranular voids resulting from Cr leaching into the salt is reduced by proton irradiation alone. Interstitial defects generated from irradiation enhance diffusion, more rapidly replenishing corrosion-injected vacancies with alloy constituents, thus playing the crucial role in decelerating corrosion. Our results show that irradiation can have a positive impact on materials performance, challenging our view that radiation damage usually results in negative effects.},

Most of the proposed MSR concepts use molten fluoride salts as coolant which can be quite corrosive to structural alloys. The results of studies on the corrosion behavior of the two alloys in molten Li2BeF4 (FLiBe) salt at 700$\,^{\circ}$C are discussed.This salt is being considered as the primary coolant for MSR designs featuring solid fuel particles, but the reported results also provide insights into the corrosion in MSR designs where the uranium fuel is dissolved in the molten fluoride salt. Corrosion was observed to occur predominantly by de-alloying of Cr from the alloy surface and into the molten salt, with more pronounced attack occurring along the grain boundaries than in the bulk grains.The magnitude and the mechanisms of corrosion were different for corrosion tests performed in graphite and metallic capsules, a result warranting recognition given the coexistence of structural alloys and graphite in the molten salt medium in the MSR.},

	abstract = {Next-generation nuclear reactor concepts and advanced techniques for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel (SNF) are drawing great attention in the nuclear field. Molten halide salts have been proposed as the fuel solvent and coolants for many molten salt reactor (MSR) concepts, and the electrolyte for the electrochemical separation of the SNF. The major concern of using molten salts is the corrosion of the structural materials imposed by these extreme environments. Materials corrosion is more challenging in the molten salt nuclear systems than in the traditional water reactors as the formation of the passivating oxide layer on the corrosion resistant alloys becomes thermodynamically unfavorable in molten salts and the use of many corrosion resistant alloys is restricted. This review takes a comprehensive approach covering all relevant work in the field: corrosion data accumulated since the 1950s to date, major corrosion problems and corresponding mechanisms, metallurgical factors, historical development of corrosion resistant alloys and recent attempts. The key environmental factors influencing corrosion in various nuclear systems, electrode kinetics, thermodynamic properties, and corrosion prevention techniques are also reviewed. Finally, current progress and challenges are summarized with an attempt at identifying knowledge gaps and future research directions.},

	abstract = {Nuclear power currently provides about 13% of electrical power worldwide, and has emerged as a reliable baseload source of electricity. A number of materials challenges must be successfully resolved for nuclear energy to continue to make further improvements in reliability, safety and economics. The operating environment for materials in current and proposed future nuclear energy systems is summarized, along with a description of materials used for the main operating components. Materials challenges associated with power uprates and extensions of the operating lifetimes of reactors are described. The three major materials challenges for the current and next generation of water-cooled fission reactors are centered on two structural materials aging degradation issues (corrosion and stress corrosion cracking of structural materials and neutron-induced embrittlement of reactor pressure vessels), along with improved fuel system reliability and accident tolerance issues. The major corrosion and stress corrosion cracking degradation mechanisms for light-water reactors are reviewed. The materials degradation issues for the Zr alloy-clad UO2 fuel system currently utilized in the majority of commercial nuclear power plants are discussed for normal and off-normal operating conditions. Looking to proposed future (Generation IV) fission and fusion energy systems, there are five key bulk radiation degradation effects (low temperature radiation hardening and embrittlement; radiation-induced and -modified solute segregation and phase stability; irradiation creep; void swelling; and high-temperature helium embrittlement) and a multitude of corrosion and stress corrosion cracking effects (including irradiation-assisted phenomena) that can have a major impact on the performance of structural materials.},

Prior to this work, there was limited experimental data published in the open literature on these systems, some of which were inconsistent and had some knowledge gaps. New equilibrium data have been obtained using Differential Scanning Calorimetry on both systems. The motivation for this experimental campaign was threefold: 1) to corroborate previously reported data, 2) to elucidate prior irregularities, and 3) fill some knowledge gaps. These measurements also revealed evidence of another stoichiometric phase, LiCsF2−β, which was not captured in previous assessments. In addition to new experimental measurements, thermodynamic treatments of the two binary systems have been revised using the CALPHAD method with the thermodynamic software FactSage and Optima. This combined experimental and computational campaign provides greater confidence in CsF thermochemical behaviour in Molten Salt Reactor systems.},

The third algorithm operates upon a logratio population covariance matrix and vector of means to produce random compositional vectors drawn from the same distribution. The statistical attributes of the crude compositional data also are honored by this method.},

@article{Harrison:2016aa,
	abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a population-based, stochastic optimization technique inspired by the social dynamics of birds. The PSO algorithm is rather sensitive to the control parameters, and thus, there has been a significant amount of research effort devoted to the dynamic adaptation of these parameters. The focus of the adaptive approaches has largely revolved around adapting the inertia weight as it exhibits the clearest relationship with the exploration/exploitation balance of the PSO algorithm. However, despite the significant amount of research efforts, many inertia weight control strategies have not been thoroughly examined analytically nor empirically. Thus, there are a plethora of choices when selecting an inertia weight control strategy, but no study has been comprehensive enough to definitively guide the selection. This paper addresses these issues by first providing an overview of 18 inertia weight control strategies. Secondly, conditions required for the strategies to exhibit convergent behaviour are derived. Finally, the inertia weight control strategies are empirically examined on a suite of 60 benchmark problems. Results of the empirical investigation show that none of the examined strategies, with the exception of a randomly selected inertia weight, even perform on par with a constant inertia weight.},

@article{Yasuda:2008aa,
	abstract = {Abstract In this paper, swarm activity is defined as the root mean square velocity of the particles in particle swarm optimization (PSO). Using numerical experiments, an investigation of the relationship between swarm activity and intensification/diversification during a PSO search, as well as the similarity between swarm activity and temperature in simulated annealing (SA), was conducted. Furthermore, a new method for determining the numerical stability of PSO based on swarm activity was developed. The stability limit for PSO based on the new numerical stability analysis method was compared with the stability limit based on a conventional analytical stability analysis method. Also, using the results of a numerical stability analysis of PSO, the search of conventional PSO methods was examined. From this analysis, issues related to diversification (global search) and intensification (local search) during the search could be explored. Finally, after showing that swarm activity can be controlled using the stable and unstable regions in PSO, a new PSO method that uses swarm activity feedback to control diversification and intensification during a search was proposed. The versatility and search capabilities of the new PSO were examined based on the results of numerical experiments using five typical benchmark problems.

@article{Deb:2000aa,
	abstract = {Many real-world search and optimization problems involve inequality and/or equality constraints and are thus posed as constrained optimization problems. In trying to solve constrained optimization problems using genetic algorithms (GAs) or classical optimization methods, penalty function methods have been the most popular approach, because of their simplicity and ease of implementation. However, since the penalty function approach is generic and applicable to any type of constraint (linear or nonlinear), their performance is not always satisfactory. Thus, researchers have developed sophisticated penalty functions specific to the problem at hand and the search algorithm used for optimization. However, the most difficult aspect of the penalty function approach is to find appropriate penalty parameters needed to guide the search towards the constrained optimum. In this paper, GA's population-based approach and ability to make pair-wise comparison in tournament selection operator are exploited to devise a penalty function approach that does not require any penalty parameter. Careful comparisons among feasible and infeasible solutions are made so as to provide a search direction towards the feasible region. Once sufficient feasible solutions are found, a niching method (along with a controlled mutation operator) is used to maintain diversity among feasible solutions. This allows a real-parameter GA's crossover operator to continuously find better feasible solutions, gradually leading the search near the true optimum solution. GAs with this constraint handling approach have been tested on nine problems commonly used in the literature, including an engineering design problem. In all cases, the proposed approach has been able to repeatedly find solutions closer to the true optimum solution than that reported earlier.},

The NVPSO algorithm [30], which uses one-dimensional search approaches to find a new feasible position on the flying trajectory of the particle when it escapes from the feasible region, has been proposed to solve COP. Experimental results showed that searching only on the flying trajectory for a feasible position influenced the diversity of the swarm and thus reduced the global search capability of the NVPSO algorithm. In order to avoid neglecting any worthy position in the feasible region and improve the optimization efficiency, a multi-dimensional search algorithm is proposed to search within a local region for a new feasible position. The local region is composed of all dimensions of the escaped particle's parent and the current positions. Obviously, the flying trajectory of the particle is also included in this local region. The new position is not only present in the feasible region but also has a better fitness value in this local region. The performance of IVPSO is tested on 13 well-known benchmark functions. Experimental results prove that the proposed IVPSO algorithm is simple, competitive and stable.},

TV-MOPSO is made adaptive in nature by allowing its vital parameters (viz., inertia weight and acceleration coefficients) to change with iterations. This adaptiveness helps the algorithm to explore the search space more efficiently. A new diversity parameter has been used to ensure sufficient diversity amongst the solutions of the non-dominated fronts, while retaining at the same time the convergence to the Pareto-optimal front. TV-MOPSO has been compared with some recently developed multi-objective PSO techniques and evolutionary algorithms for 11 function optimization problems, using different performance measures.},

	abstract = {The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a relatively new generation of combinatorial metaheuristic algorithms which is based on a metaphor of social interaction, namely bird flocking or fish schooling. Although the algorithm has shown some important advances by providing high speed of convergence in specific problems it has also been reported that the algorithm has a tendency to get stuck in a near optimal solution and may find it difficult to improve solution accuracy by fine tuning. The present paper proposes a new variation of PSO model where we propose a new method of introducing nonlinear variation of inertia weight along with a particle's old velocity to improve the speed of convergence as well as fine tune the search in the multidimensional space. The paper also presents a new method of determining and setting a complete set of free parameters for any given problem, saving the user from a tedious trial and error based approach to determine them for each specific problem. The performance of the proposed PSO model, along with the fixed set of free parameters, is amply demonstrated by applying it for several benchmark problems and comparing it with several competing popular PSO and non-PSO combinatorial metaheuristic algorithms.},

@article{Harrison:2018aa,
	abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a population-based, stochastic search algorithm inspired by the flocking behaviour of birds. The PSO algorithm has been shown to be rather sensitive to its control parameters, and thus, performance may be greatly improved by employing appropriately tuned parameters. However, parameter tuning is typically a time-intensive empirical process. Furthermore, a priori parameter tuning makes the implicit assumption that the optimal parameters of the PSO algorithm are not time-dependent. To address these issues, self-adaptive particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) algorithms adapt their control parameters throughout execution. While there is a wide variety of such SAPSO algorithms in the literature, their behaviours are not well understood. Specifically, it is unknown whether these SAPSO algorithms will even exhibit convergent behaviour. This paper addresses this lack of understanding by investigating the convergence behaviours of 18 SAPSO algorithms both analytically and empirically. This paper also empirically examines whether the adapted parameters reach a stable point and whether the final parameter values adhere to a well-known convergence criterion. The results depict a grim state for SAPSO algorithms; over half of the SAPSO algorithms exhibit divergent behaviour while many others prematurely converge.},

	abstract = {An adaptive parameter tuning of particle swarm optimization based on velocity information (APSO-VI) algorithm is proposed. In this paper the velocity convergence of particles is first analyzed and the relationship between the velocity of particle and the search failures is pointed out, which reveals the reasons why PSO has relative poor global searching ability. Then this algorithm introduces the velocity information which is defined as the average absolute value of velocity of all the particles. A new strategy is presented that the inertia weight is dynamically adjusted according to average absolute value of velocity which follows a given nonlinear ideal velocity by feedback control, which can avoid the velocity closed to zero at the early stage. Under the guide of the nonlinear ideal velocity, APSO-VI can maintain appropriate swarm diversity and alleviate the premature convergence validly. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the proposed algorithm with different variants of PSO on some benchmark functions. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm remarkably improves the ability of PSO to jump out of the local optima and significantly enhance the convergence speed and precision.},

In this nature-based algorithm, individuals are referred to as particles and fly through the search space seeking for the global best position that minimises (or maximises) a given problem. Today, PSO is one of the most well-known and widely used swarm intelligence algorithms and metaheuristic techniques, because of its simplicity and ability to be used in a wide range of applications. However, in-depth studies of the algorithm have led to the detection and identification of a number of problems with it, especially convergence problems and performance issues. Consequently, a myriad of variants, enhancements and extensions to the original version of the algorithm, developed and introduced in the mid-1990s, have been proposed, especially in the last two decades. In this article, a systematic literature review about those variants and improvements is made, which also covers the hybridisation and parallelisation of the algorithm and its extensions to other classes of optimisation problems, taking into consideration the most important ones. These approaches and improvements are appropriately summarised, organised and presented, in order to allow and facilitate the identification of the most appropriate PSO variant for a particular application.},

	abstract = {Abstract Prediction of stable mineral equilibria in the Earth's lithosphere is critical to unravel the tectonomagmatic history of exposed geological sections. While the recent advances in geodynamic modeling allow us to explore the dynamics of magmatic transfer in solid mediums, there is to date no available thermodynamic package that can easily be linked and efficiently be accounted for the computation of phase equilibrium in magmatic systems. Moreover, none of the existing tools fully exploit single point calculation parallelization, which strongly hinders their applicability for direct geodynamic coupling or for thermodynamic database inversions. Here, we present a new Mineral Assemblage Gibbs Energy Minimizer (magemin). The package is written as a parallel C library, provides a direct Julia interface, and is callable from any petrological/geodynamic tool. For a given set of pressure, temperature, and bulk-rock composition magemin uses a combination of linear programming, extended Partitioning Gibbs Energy and gradient-based local minimization to compute the stable mineral assemblage. We apply our new minimization package to the igneous thermodynamic data set of Holland et al. (2018), https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egy048 and produce several phase diagrams at supra-solidus conditions. The phase diagrams are then directly benchmarked against thermocalc and exhibit very good agreement. The high scalability of magemin on parallel computing facilities opens new horizons, for example, for modeling reactive magma flow, for thermodynamic data set inversion, and for petrological/geophysical applications.},

In this paper, the problem is approached using an entirely continuous model. Compared to previous models, the proposed formulation allows for more general objective functions. In solving the continuous model, minimizing its nonconvex objective function poses the major obstacle. We overcome this obstacle by means of a branch-and-bound global optimization algorithm that exploits the concavity and separability of the objective function and the linearity of the constraint set. The algorithm terminates with the exact global optimum in a finite number of iterations. In addition, computational results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is very efficient as, for a number of problems from the literature, it outperforms OSL, a popular integer programming package. We also develop a procedure for generating test problems of this kind.},

	abstract = {This work addresses the development of an efficient solution strategy for obtaining global optima of continuous, integer, and mixed-integer nonlinear programs. Towards this end, we develop novel relaxation schemes, range reduction tests, and branching strategies which we incorporate into the prototypical branch-and-bound algorithm. In the theoretical/algorithmic part of the paper, we begin by developing novel strategies for constructing linear relaxations of mixed-integer nonlinear programs and prove that these relaxations enjoy quadratic convergence properties. We then use Lagrangian/linear programming duality to develop a unifying theory of domain reduction strategies as a consequence of which we derive many range reduction strategies currently used in nonlinear programming and integer linear programming. This theory leads to new range reduction schemes, including a learning heuristic that improves initial branching decisions by relaying data across siblings in a branch-and-bound tree. Finally, we incorporate these relaxation and reduction strategies in a branch-and-bound algorithm that incorporates branching strategies that guarantee finiteness for certain classes of continuous global optimization problems. In the computational part of the paper, we describe our implementation discussing, wherever appropriate, the use of suitable data structures and associated algorithms. We present computational experience with benchmark separable concave quadratic programs, fractional 0--1 programs, and mixed-integer nonlinear programs from applications in synthesis of chemical processes, engineering design, just-in-time manufacturing, and molecular design.},

This formulation is used within a spatial branch and bound search. The application of this method is considered in detail for sharp separation systems with single feed and mixed products.

@article{Adjiman:1997aa,
	abstract = {Two new methodologies for the global optimization of MINLP models, the Special structure Mixed Integer Nonlinear αBB,SMIN-αBB, and the General structure Mixed Integer Nonlinear αBB,GMIN-αBB, are presented. Their theoretical foundations provide guarantees that the global optimum solution of MINLPs involving twice-differentiable nonconvex functions in the continuous variables can be identified. The conditions imposed on the functionality of the binary variables differ for each method: linear and mixed bilinear terms can be treated with the SMIN-αBB; mixed nonlinear terms whose continuous relaxation is twice-differentiable are handled by the GMIN-αBB. While both algorithms use the concept of a branch & bound tree, they rely on fundamentally different bounding and branching strategies. In the GMIN-αBB algorithm, lower (upper) bounds at each node result from the solution of convex (nonconvex) MINLPs derived from the original problem. The construction of convex lower bounding MINLPs, using the techniques recently developed for the generation of valid convex underestimators for twice-differentiable functions (Adjiman et al., 1996; Adjiman and Floudas, 1996), is an essential task as it allows to solve the underestimating problems to global optimality using the GBD algorithm or the OA algorithm, provided that the binary variables participate separably and linearly. Moreover, the inherent structure of the MINLP problem can be fully exploited as branching is performed on the binary and the continuous variables. In the case of the SMIN-αBB algorithm, the lower and upper bounds are obtained by solving continuous relaxations of the original MINLP. Using the αBB algorithm, these nonconvex NLPs are solved as global optimization problems and hence valid lower bounds are generated. Since branching is performed exclusively on the binary variables, the maximum size of the branch-and-bound tree is smaller than that for the SMIN-αBB. The two proposed approaches are used to generate computational results on various nonconvex MINLP problems that arise in the areas of Process Synthesis and Design.},

Finding good software engineering solutions for these difficulties is not enough to make sure that the outcome will be a GO software that works well. However, starting from a sound software design makes it easy to concentrate on improving the efficiency of the global optimization algorithm implementation.

A thermodynamic description is developed by means of the calculations of phase diagrams (CALPHAD) method using experimental and computational data from the present work and the literature. Emphasis is placed on modeling the bcc-A2, B2, fcc-γ, and tetragonal-σ phases in the temperature range of 1173 to 1623 K. Liquid, bcc-A2 and fcc-γ phases are modeled using substitutional solution descriptions. First-principles special quasirandom structures (SQS) calculations predict a large bcc-A2 (disordered)/B2 (ordered) miscibility gap, in agreement with experiments.

The PGE approach, however, has considerable convergence issues when applied to highly non-ideal solution phases and therefore was eventually abandoned in Thermochimica. This corrigendum illustrates the convergence issues and their underlying cause with the aim of informing the readers about the reasoning for adopting GEM in place of PGE in Thermochimica and may help their own decision making in selecting an algorithm for their own software.},

	abstract = {Modern computational thermodynamics methods rely on the use of numerical models that represent chemical systems. Typically, these models are formulated in terms of the Gibbs energy, which must be minimised to find the conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium. Numerous thermodynamic models have been developed to capture the behaviour of regular solid and liquid solutions, ionic ceramics, multi-sublattice metallic alloys, short and long range ordering, and much more. Some classes of commonly used thermodynamic models include substitutional solutions and compound energy formalism. The mathematical formulation of the Gibbs energy of a solution phase represented by any of the aforementioned models takes on a unique form, which requires special consideration for obtaining the partial derivatives in the Hessian matrix of a Gibbs energy minimiser. This paper provides derivations of the partial molar excess Gibbs energy of mixing of some common classes of thermodynamic models for use in a Gibbs energy minimiser.},

	abstract = {Calculation of phase and chemical equilibrium represents a crucial phase in the modeling of many separation processes. For conditions of constant temperature and pressure, a necessary and sufficient condition for the true equilibrium solution is that (i) the total Gibbs free energy of the system be at its global minimum, or (ii) the minimum of the tangent plane distance function be nonnegative for all phase models used to represent the system. In this work, the goal is to obtain equilibrium solutions corresponding to a global minimum of the Gibbs free energy as efficiently as possible, for cases where the liquid phase or phases can be modeled by the NRTL, UNIQUAC, UNIFAC, Wilson, modified Wilson and ASOG equations. Vapor phases whose behavior can be described as ideal can also be handled. In achieving this goal, there are two distinct problems of relevance: (i) the minimization of the Gibbs free energy, denoted (G), and (ii) the minimization of the tangent plane distance function, or the tangent plane stability criterion, denoted (S). For all these activity coefficient models, GLOPEQ (GLobal OPtimization for the Phase and chemical EQuilibrium problem) can guarantee global solutions for problems (G) and (S), but a combined algorithm employs them in tandem, using (G) to generate candidate equilibrium solutions which can then be verified for thermodynamic stability by solving (S). Two key features of the combined algorithm are that (i) as much information as is possible is obtained from local searches, and (ii) it is preferable to verify a globally stable equilibrium solution using the tangent plane criterion, as this problem contains fewer variables than the minimization of the Gibbs free energy. Results for several examples are presented, and all but one of them are for the case of phase equilibrium, due to the paucity of examples for reacting systems that employ excess Gibbs free energy models.},

	abstract = {Methods for multiphase equilibrium calculations are generally based on Gibbs free energy minimization or equation-solving. Equation-solving methods, although superior to free energy minimization methods for phase equilibrium calculations without chemical reactions, often involve sequential procedures for a priori phase identification. A simultaneous equation-solving method (τ-method), based on modifying mole fraction summations, is proposed for these calculations. It requires the solution of a minimization problem only once, and provides phases actually present at equilibrium, their quantities and compositions simultaneously; and phase identification in advance is not required. Phase characteristic variable and pseudo phase are introduced, and their significance discussed. τ-method is shown by analysis and numerical results, to be consistent with Nelson's (1987, Comput. Chem. Engng 11, 581--591) criteria for phase existence. The method is tested on typical examples for two-phase (vapor--liquid and liquid--liquid) and three-phase (vapor--liquid--liquid) equilibrium calculations. For each example, several conditions and/or different initializations are used, and the minimization problem is solved by a version of successive linear programming method. The results show that τ-method is successful and reliable for multiphase equilibrium calculations.},

Results obtained with typical examples for vapor--liquid equilibrium and vapor--liquid equilibrium with reaction, where the liquid and vapor phases may be non-ideal, show that the LJ optimization procedure can be used to find very accurately the global minimum in only a few seconds of computation time on a personal computer.

The code has been upgraded to couple the description of irradiated fuel thermochemistry already available with oxygen transport taking into account thermodiffusion. The impact of oxygen redistribution during a power transient on irradiated fuel thermochemistry in the fuel and on chemically reactive gas release from the fuel (I(g), I2(g), CsI(g), TeI2(g), Cs(g), Cs2(g)) is studied. The simulations show that oxygen redistribution, even if moderate in magnitude, leads to the reduction of metallic oxides (molybdenum dioxide, cesium molybdates, chromium oxide) at the fuel pellet center and consequently to the release of a much greater quantity of gaseous cesium. Pellet-Cladding Interaction failure propensity is shown to decrease in consequence of the thermodynamically favourable reaction of iodine with released cesium in the free volume of the rod.},

Operating conditions such as high temperatures, irradiation and a corrosive environment degrade materials properties, posing the risk of very expensive or even catastrophic plant damage. Materials scientists are faced with the scientific challenge to determine the long-term damage evolution of materials under service exposure in advanced plants. A higher confidence in life-time assessments of these materials requires an understanding of the related physical phenomena on a range of scales from the microscopic level of single defect damage effects all the way up to macroscopic effects. To overcome lengthy and expensive trial-and-error experiments, the multiscale modelling of materials behaviour is a promising tool, bringing new insights into the fundamental understanding of basic mechanisms. This paper presents the multiscale modelling methodology which is taking root internationally to address the issues of advanced structural materials for Gen IV reactors.},

	abstract = {This study proposes an approach for capturing the effect of microstructural evolution on reactor fuel performance by coupling a mesoscale irradiated microstructure model with a finite element fuel performance code. To achieve this, the macroscale system is solved in a parallel, fully coupled, fully-implicit manner using the preconditioned Jacobian-free Newton Krylov (JFNK) method. Within the JFNK solution algorithm, microstructure-influenced material parameters are calculated by the mesoscale model and passed back to the macroscale calculation. Due to the stochastic nature of the mesoscale model, a dynamic fitting technique is implemented to smooth roughness in the calculated material parameters. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on a simple model of a reactor fuel pellet. In the model, INL's BISON fuel performance code calculates the steady-state temperature profile in a fuel pellet and the microstructure-influenced thermal conductivity is determined with a phase field model of irradiated microstructures. This simple multiscale model demonstrates good nonlinear convergence and near ideal parallel scalability. By capturing the formation of large mesoscale voids in the pellet interior, the multiscale model predicted the irradiation-induced reduction in the thermal conductivity commonly observed in reactors.},

	abstract = {Nuclear fuel operates in an environment that induces complex multiphysics phenomena, occurring over distances ranging from inter-atomic spacing to meters, and times scales ranging from microseconds to years. This multiphysics behavior is often tightly coupled and many important aspects are inherently multidimensional. Most current fuel modeling codes employ loose multiphysics coupling and are restricted to 2D axisymmetric or 1.5D approximations. This paper describes a new modeling tool able to simulate coupled multiphysics and multiscale fuel behavior, for either 2D axisymmetric or 3D geometries. Specific fuel analysis capabilities currently implemented in this tool are described, followed by a set of demonstration problems which include a 10-pellet light water reactor fuel rodlet, three-dimensional analysis of pellet clad mechanical interaction in the vicinity of a defective fuel pellet, coupled heat transfer and fission product diffusion in a TRISO-coated fuel particle, a demonstration of the ability to couple to lower-length scale models to account for material property variation with microstructural evolution, and a demonstration of the tool's ability to efficiently solve very large and complex problems using massively-parallel computing. A final section describes an early validation exercise, comparing simulation results to a light water reactor fuel rod experiment.},

	abstract = {Computation of phase equilibrium is a very important and frequently encountered problem in process systems engineering. Accurate and robust flash routines are at the core of the major part of chemical engineering design applications, ranging from pipelines to distillation columns, chemical reactors, and oil and gas production. The multiphase equilibrium calculation by the direct minimization of the Gibbs free energy has some potential advantages over classical methods, mainly because the equality of chemical potentials is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for equilibrium. Recent developments in global optimization and the availability of very fast computers have stimulated the research on the direct minimization approach. In this work, a hybrid method (genetic algorithm for the global search and interior point for refinement) was implemented and the efficiency/reliability relation was studied. For some systems the global minimum can be found in a NFE compatible with the methods currently available in process simulators. But, it was also found that, for some systems, there is an asymptotic behavior. Apparently, a reliability of 100 %, when using global search algorithms with some random nature, would be found only for an infinite number of function evaluations.},

For non-reactive systems, this equation system is solved by considering conventional composition variables while for reactive cases we use the transformed composition variables proposed by Ung and Doherty. Numerical performance of our approach is illustrated using several examples previously reported in the literature and results show that it is a suitable and robust strategy for the calculation of homogeneous azeotropes in mixtures with or without chemical reactions.},

	abstract = {Phase equilibrium modeling plays an important role in design, optimization and control of separation processes. The global optimization problem involved in phase equilibrium calculations is very challenging due to the high non-linearity of thermodynamic models especially for multi-component systems subject to chemical reactions. To date, a few attempts have been made in the application of stochastic methods for reactive phase equilibrium calculations compared to those reported for non-reactive systems. In particular, the population-based stochastic methods are known for their good exploration abilities and, when optimal balance between the exploration and exploitation is found, they can be reliable and efficient global optimizers. Genetic algorithms (GAs) and differential evolution with tabu list (DETL) have been very successful for performing phase equilibrium calculations in non-reactive systems. However, there are no previous studies on the performance of both these strategies to solve the Gibbs free energy minimization problem for systems subject to chemical equilibrium. In this study, the constrained and unconstrained Gibbs free energy minimization in reactive systems have been analyzed and used to assess the performance of GA and DETL. Specifically, the numerical performance of these stochastic methods have been tested using both conventional and transformed composition variables as the decision vector for free energy minimization in reactive systems, and their relative strengths are discussed. The results of these strategies are compared with those obtained using SA, which has shown competitive performance in reactive phase equilibrium calculations. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies in the literature on the comparison of reactive phase equilibrium using both the formulations with stochastic global optimization methods. Our results show that the effectiveness of the stochastic methods tested depends on the stopping criterion, the type of decision variables, and the use of local optimization for intensification stage. Overall, unconstrained Gibbs free energy minimization involving transformed composition variables requires more computational time compared to constrained minimization, and DETL has better performance for both constrained and unconstrained Gibbs free energy minimization in reactive systems.},

A local optimization technique is used at the end of both TS and DE to improve the accuracy of the final solution. Benchmark problems involve 2--20 variables with a few to hundreds of local minima whereas PEC and PS problems consist of multiple components with comparable minima.

	abstract = {An enhanced simulated annealing algorithm (SAA) is presented to verify the phase stability analysis and obtain the true solution of the phase equilibrium problem of multi-component systems at high pressures. Using the enhanced SAA, the global stability analysis is checked on the basis of the minimization results of the tangent plane distance functions (TPDF) for the systems where the nonideal phases are described by PR or SRK equations of state. The consequent phase equilibrium calculation is accomplished by the Newton--Raphson method based upon the stability analysis results. The calculation results for three systems including ternary, quaternary, and five-component mixtures that exhibit multiple immiscibility gaps with different charges at elevated pressures state that the combined algorithm can effectively locate the global minima of these systems involving symmetric models, then the final stability analysis implemented is used to ensure the global minimization. In comparison with MULPRG and HOMPEQ developed by Michelsen and Sun and Seider (1995, Fluid phase Equilibrium, 103, 213--249) respectively, the enhanced SAA is slightly slower and provides comparable reliability, but it is self-starting.},

	abstract = {The determination of the correct number of equilibrium phases and their corresponding compositions at fixed temperature and pressure (TP flash) is studied. The novel aspects of this work center around unique initialization strategies and successive quadratic programming (SQP) enhancements that include the use of (1) only binary tangent plane analyses; (2) the determination of all partially miscible binary pairs and a dominant immiscible pair; (3) novel relative solubility calculations based on component activities and double tangency separation; (4) least squares solutions to compute phase fraction estimates; (5) a variety of algorithmic features that dynamically trap difficulties such as compositions well below machine accuracy, and trivial and collapsed solutions and (6) a posteriori testing of phase and solution stability. The overall algorithmic framework is one based on using a combination of binary tangent plane analyses, bubble point calculations and dimensionless Gibbs free energy minimizations. Binary tangent plane analyses are used to identify all immiscible or partially miscible binary pairs and to avoid dimensionality difficulties associated with locating all stationary points in the tangent plane distance function in the full composition space. The proposed approach consists of solving a sequence of subproblems (i.e. LE, LLE, VLLE,{\ldots}) until the global minimum dimensionless Gibbs free energy (G/RT) is found. Maximum information from binary tangent plane analyses and previously solved subproblems are used to generate initial values for the next subproblem. The concept of relative solubilities is introduced and used to initialize phase compositions in all LLE calculations (i.e. phase split or flash). All completely miscible component relative solubilities are calculated using component activities while those for immiscible or partially miscible components are initialized using double tangency separation. Phase fractions are initialized using a least-square solution to the set of component mass balances. All subproblems are formulated in terms of component flows and solved using a full space SQP method using a modified Broyden--Fletcher--Goldfarb--Shanno (BFGS) update of the Lagrangian Hessian matrix. The proposed algorithm was tested within the Aspen Plus process simulator using a variety of physical properties options. Twenty six multicomponent mixtures including some four-phase (VLLLE) emulsion polymerization problems were used to test the proposed algorithm. All problems were easily solved and clearly demonstrate the capabilities of the present multiphase TP flash model.},

	abstract = {Abstract
A reliable algorithm for the solution of fluid phase equilibrium at constant pressure and temperature (P, T flash) is presented. The approach is applicable to multi-component mixtures described with general equations of state and is based on a formulation of P, T phase equilibrium as a dual optimisation problem in volume-composition space, translated away from the Gibbs free energy to the Helmholtz free energy. This formulation facilitates the use of guaranteed solution algorithms, particularly in the case of sophisticated equations of state (EOSs) such as SAFT (statistical associating fluid theory), because such representations are higher-than-cubic functions in volume and are formulated in the Helmholtz free energy. With the proposed algorithm (which is based on a combination of local and global optimisation, where the number of subproblems to be solved globally is kept at a minimum) one is guaranteed to identify the number of stable phases present at equilibrium, along with their properties, without any need for initial guesses, or indeed any a priori knowledge about the behaviour of the system. The method is applicable to the calculation of any kind of fluid phase behaviour (e.g., vapour--liquid (VLE), liquid--liquid (LLE), vapour--liquid--liquid (VLLE), etc.). Several algorithmic options are investigated and their computational performance compared. A prototype implementation is used to determine the fluid phase equilibria of a number of binary and ternary systems, where the thermodynamic properties are calculated through a molecular-based EOS. Examples are shown for the VLE and VLLE for mixtures modelled with an augmented van der Waals EOS, a non-cubic EOS that incorporates the Carnahan and Starling representation of the repulsive interactions. Further examples are presented for VLE and VLLE in polymer systems, modelled with an EOS of the generic SAFT form. Fluid phase equilibrium calculations for polymer systems are notoriously difficult, and convergence problems are often encountered, even with good initial guesses. The proposed method is found to be reliable in all cases examined.},

Both cases could be handled as optimization problems, satisfying the restrictions imposed by mole or atom balances, and non-negativity of number of moles. Convexity analyses were carried out, and the conditions were found in order to guarantee global minimum, for one liquid phase, one gas phase, and a number of solid phases.

	abstract = {Recently, significant attention has been shown to physical and chemical equilibrium and stability analysis in the real and complex domains. In this work, a new procedure involving the continuation method in the complex domain using bifurcation theory is propounded. Based on this method, homotopy branches in real and complex space are connected to each other through bifurcation branches. Thus, by just one initial guess, multiple solution branches are found. When calculations are only made in the real domain, multiple solutions are not always found from an arbitrary initial guess. Examples are presented to show the application of the method to nonlinear sets of equations in phase equilibrium, chemical and phase equilibrium, and stability analysis. These types of problems are believed to contain significant nonlinearities in process simulations. The results can be applied to flowsheet calculations.},

	abstract = {Phase equilibrium calculations are often involved in the design, simulation, and optimization of chemical processes. Reported methods for these calculations are based on either equation-solving or Gibbs free energy minimization approaches. The main objective of this work is to compare selected methods for these two approaches, in terms of reliability to find the correct solution, computational time, and number of K-value evaluations. For this, four equation-solving and three free minimization methods have been selected and applied to commonly encountered vapour--liquid equilibrium (VLE), liquid--liquid equilibrium (LLE), and vapour--liquid--liquid equilibrium (VLLE) examples involving multiple components and popular thermodynamic models. Detailed results show that the equation-solving method based on the Rachford--Rice formulation accompanied by mean value theorem and Wegstein's projection is reliable and efficient for two-phase equilibrium calculations not having local minima. When there are multiple minima and for three-phase equilibrium, the stochastic method, genetic algorithm (GA) followed by modified simplex method of Nelder and Mead (NM) is more reliable and desirable. Generic programs for numerical methods are ineffective for phase equilibrium calculations. These findings are of interest and value to researchers and engineers working on phase equilibrium calculations and/or developing thermodynamic models for phase behaviour.},

The method is a steepest descent search for the minimum of the free energy of the system. It makes no assumptions regarding reactions taking place between the various species in the system, nor is there a limit to the number of solid species that can be included in the search. The only information necessary is the free energy as a function of temperature of all species that can be present under the given conditions. The method is particularly useful for calculations on small sized computers, such as the Bendix G-15-D for which it has been programmed. It has been found to have several advantages over published methods(1, 3). The searching method described can also be used for a variety of other problems, e.g. computation of changes in equilibrium composition with temperature.},

	abstract = {The Gibbs energy minimization encompasses active use of the chemical potentials (partial molar Gibbs energies) of the constituents of the system. Usually, these appear at their equilibrium values as a result of the minimization calculation, the mass balance constraints being the necessary subsidiary conditions. Yet, there are several such physico-chemical circumstances where the system is also constrained by other factors, such as surface effects, potential fields or even by chemical reaction kinetics. In this paper a particular method is presented by which constrained chemical potentials can be applied in a multi-phase Gibbs energy minimization. The constrained potentials arise typically from work-related thermodynamic displacements in the system. When Gibbs energy minimization is performed by the Lagrange method, these constraints appear as additional Lagrangian multipliers. Examples of the constrained potential method are presented in terms of the electrochemical Donnan equilibria in aqueous systems containing semi-permeable interfaces, the phase formation in surface-energy controlled systems and in systems with affinities controlled by chemical reaction kinetics. The methods have been applied successfully in calculating distribution coefficients for metal ions together with pH-values in pulp suspensions, in the calculation of surface tension of alloys, and in thermochemical process modeling involving chemical reaction rates.},

	abstract = {Computation of chemical equilibria in multiphase systems by Gibbs free energy minimization under constraints set by the material balance has increasing interest in many application fields, including materials technology, metallurgy and chemical engineering. The results are utilised in multi-phase equilibrium studies or as parts of equilibrium-based process simulation. Yet, there exist a number of practical problems where the chemical system is influenced by other constraining factors such as surface energy or electrochemical charge transport. For such systems, an extended Gibbs energy method has been applied. In the new method, the potential energy is introduced to the Gibbs energy calculation as a Legendre transformed work term divided into substance specific contributions. The additional constraint potential is then represented by a supplementary undertermined Lagrange multiplier. In addition, upper bounds on the amounts of products can be set, which then limit the maximum extents of selected spontaneous chemical reactions in terms of affinity. The range of Gibbs energy calculations can then be extended to new intricate systems. Example models based on free energy minimisation have been made e.g. for surface and interfacial systems, where the surface, interfacial or adsorbed atomic or molecular layers are modeled as separate phases. In an analogous fashion the partitioning effect of a semi-permeable membrane in a two-compartment aqueous system can be modeled. In such system the large ions, not permeable through the membrane, cause an uneven charge distribution of ionic species between the two compartments. In this case, the electrochemical potential difference between the two aqueous phases becomes calculated for the multi-component system. The calculated results are consistent with the Donnan equilibrium theory; however the multi-phase system may also include the gas phase and several precipitating phases, which extends the applicability of the new method. Finally, similar constraints can also be set to extents of reaction advancements, allowing usage of Gibbs energy calculations in dynamic reaction rate controlled systems.},

MALT encourages users to utilize thermodynamic data in the databases as well as their own in thermodynamic analysis on their own materials/processes problems. To facilitate it, MALT provides the function called ``MALT Direct,'' which can make access to the data users prepare, and can utilize them in their own programs written in Pascal and compiled in Delphi.

An algorithm previously proposed for isothermal multiphase flash problems is extended and modified for systems with reversible chemical reactions. A method for the automatic selection of independent chemical reactions is improved and extended to nonideal mixtures. The iterative calculations are initialized with an accelerated direct substitution procedure. A second-order minimization algorithm is utilized for the final iterations. The differential phase stability test is applied to verify the need for adding new phases to the system. Phase removal is tried even for two-phase systems whereas, in flash problems without reaction, phase removal only needs to be attempted for systems with three or more phases. Examples that illustrate the performance of the method for mixtures with nonideal phases are presented.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the coupling of the fuel performance code ALCYONE with the thermochemical code ANGE and its application to Iodine-Stress Corrosion Cracking (I-SCC). The coupling is illustrated by a 3D simulation of a power ramp. The release of chemically active gases (CsI(g), Tex(1<x<7)(g), TeI2(g), I(g), I2(g){\ldots}) is studied. The calculated radial distributions of iodine, cesium, tellurium and inert fission gas in the pellet fragment before and after the power ramp are successfully compared to Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) measurements. Based on the 3D simulation, the definition of a stress corrosion initiation criterion is discussed. The combination of the hoop stress and of the quantity of reactive iodine (I(g), I2(g) and TeI2(g) only) released by the pellet is used to show that the necessary conditions for Pellet Cladding Interaction-Stress Corrosion Cracking (PCI-SCC) initiation, based on out-of-pile I-SCC laboratory tests criteria, are met during the simulated power transient.},

	abstract = {The present study describes the full thermodynamic assessment of the Li,Cs,Th//F,I system. The existing database for the relevant fluoride salts considered as fuel for the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) has been extended with two key fission products, cesium and iodine. A complete evaluation of all the common-ion binary and ternary sub-systems of the LiF-ThF4-CsF-LiI-ThI4-CsI system has been performed and the optimized parameters are presented in this work. New equilibrium data have been measured using Differential Scanning Calorimetry and were used to assess the reciprocal ternary systems and confirm the extrapolated phase diagrams. The developed database significantly contributes to the understanding of the behaviour of cesium and iodine in the MSR, which strongly depends on their concentration and chemical form. Cesium bonded with fluorine is well retained in the fuel mixture while in the form of CsI the solubility of these elements is very limited. Finally, the influence of CsI and CsF on the physico-chemical properties of the fuel mixture was calculated as function of composition.},
