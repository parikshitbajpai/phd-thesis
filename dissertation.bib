	abstract = {The CALPHAD method has been highly relied upon for material design and development and a number of software packages have been developed for computing thermodynamic equilibrium. While Gibbs Energy Minimisation (GEM) has been the most commonly used algorithm for thermodynamic equilibrium calculations, an alternative technique namely Partitioning of Gibbs Energy Minimisation (PGE) was advanced and applied to the thermochemistry library Thermochimica due to some of its numerical advantages. The PGE approach, however, has considerable convergence issues when applied to highly non-ideal solution phases and therefore was eventually abandoned in Thermochimica. This corrigendum illustrates the convergence issues and their underlying cause with the aim of informing the readers about the reasoning for adopting GEM in place of PGE in Thermochimica and may help their own decision making in selecting an algorithm for their own software.},

Here, the derivations necessary to obtain the chemical potentials of the quadruplet species required for Gibbs energy minimization are provided. The implementation is verified via code-to-code benchmarking against FactSage. A scheme to increase computational efficiency of multi-physics simulations including Thermochimica is described and its effectiveness for molten salt systems demonstrated. Finally, a multi-physics simulation of a molten salt nuclear fuel system is presented as a demonstration problem: ORIGEN-S is used to calculate the isotopic evolution of a fuel-loaded FLiBe mixture with fission and activation products as Thermochimica predicts the phase evolution and number of moles of Cs in various phases.},

@article{Bajpai:2021aa,
	abstract = {Modern computational thermodynamics methods rely on the use of numerical models that represent chemical systems. Typically, these models are formulated in terms of the Gibbs energy, which must be minimised to find the conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium. Numerous thermodynamic models have been developed to capture the behaviour of regular solid and liquid solutions, ionic ceramics, multi-sublattice metallic alloys, short and long range ordering, and much more. Some classes of commonly used thermodynamic models include substitutional solutions and compound energy formalism. The mathematical formulation of the Gibbs energy of a solution phase represented by any of the aforementioned models takes on a unique form, which requires special consideration for obtaining the partial derivatives in the Hessian matrix of a Gibbs energy minimiser. This paper provides derivations of the partial molar excess Gibbs energy of mixing of some common classes of thermodynamic models for use in a Gibbs energy minimiser.},

@article{MCDONALD19971,
	abstract = {Calculation of phase and chemical equilibrium represents a crucial phase in the modeling of many separation processes. For conditions of constant temperature and pressure, a necessary and sufficient condition for the true equilibrium solution is that (i) the total Gibbs free energy of the system be at its global minimum, or (ii) the minimum of the tangent plane distance function be nonnegative for all phase models used to represent the system. In this work, the goal is to obtain equilibrium solutions corresponding to a global minimum of the Gibbs free energy as efficiently as possible, for cases where the liquid phase or phases can be modeled by the NRTL, UNIQUAC, UNIFAC, Wilson, modified Wilson and ASOG equations. Vapor phases whose behavior can be described as ideal can also be handled. In achieving this goal, there are two distinct problems of relevance: (i) the minimization of the Gibbs free energy, denoted (G), and (ii) the minimization of the tangent plane distance function, or the tangent plane stability criterion, denoted (S). For all these activity coefficient models, GLOPEQ (GLobal OPtimization for the Phase and chemical EQuilibrium problem) can guarantee global solutions for problems (G) and (S), but a combined algorithm employs them in tandem, using (G) to generate candidate equilibrium solutions which can then be verified for thermodynamic stability by solving (S). Two key features of the combined algorithm are that (i) as much information as is possible is obtained from local searches, and (ii) it is preferable to verify a globally stable equilibrium solution using the tangent plane criterion, as this problem contains fewer variables than the minimization of the Gibbs free energy. Results for several examples are presented, and all but one of them are for the case of phase equilibrium, due to the paucity of examples for reacting systems that employ excess Gibbs free energy models.},

@article{HAN1998897,
	abstract = {Methods for multiphase equilibrium calculations are generally based on Gibbs free energy minimization or equation-solving. Equation-solving methods, although superior to free energy minimization methods for phase equilibrium calculations without chemical reactions, often involve sequential procedures for a priori phase identification. A simultaneous equation-solving method (τ-method), based on modifying mole fraction summations, is proposed for these calculations. It requires the solution of a minimization problem only once, and provides phases actually present at equilibrium, their quantities and compositions simultaneously; and phase identification in advance is not required. Phase characteristic variable and pseudo phase are introduced, and their significance discussed. τ-method is shown by analysis and numerical results, to be consistent with Nelson's (1987, Comput. Chem. Engng 11, 581--591) criteria for phase existence. The method is tested on typical examples for two-phase (vapor--liquid and liquid--liquid) and three-phase (vapor--liquid--liquid) equilibrium calculations. For each example, several conditions and/or different initializations are used, and the minimization problem is solved by a version of successive linear programming method. The results show that τ-method is successful and reliable for multiphase equilibrium calculations.},

	abstract = {Direct search optimization is applied to Gibbs free energy minimization to determine phase compositions at equilibrium. The method selected is the random search optimization procedure of Luus and Jaakola, which has been shown to be successful for solving difficult global optimization problems. It is implemented in a multipass fashion where the region size for a variable at the beginning of each pass is put equal to the change in that variable in the previous pass. Results obtained with typical examples for vapor--liquid equilibrium and vapor--liquid equilibrium with reaction, where the liquid and vapor phases may be non-ideal, show that the LJ optimization procedure can be used to find very accurately the global minimum in only a few seconds of computation time on a personal computer. The method is easy to use and has high reliability of locating the global optimum, thus providing a useful means of checking the results obtained by other methods.},

	abstract = {A general purpose open source, Python-based framework, Gibbs, is presented to perform multiphysical equilibrium calculations of material properties. The developed architecture allows to prototype symbolic and numerical representations of materials by starting from analytic models, tabulated experimental data, or Thermo-Calc data files. These constructions are based on the addition of arbitrary energy contributions that range from the traditional thermochemical to mechanical and surface tension. Gibbs seamlessly interfaces with FiPy to prototype interdiffusion and microstructural evolution (phase field) models. Through its flexible Graphical User Interface, Gibbs allows rapid deployment of computational thermodynamic applications with intuitive user interfaces, and through the developed viewers, direct visualization and analysis of data can be readily performed for those physical properties that are relevant for the problem at hand. Example applications to chemically homogeneous ferroelectrics and two component (binary) solids are presented.},

	abstract = {This paper presents 3D simulations of power ramps in pressurized water reactors with the fuel performance code ALCYONE, which is part of the computing environment PLEIADES. The code has been upgraded to couple the description of irradiated fuel thermochemistry already available with oxygen transport taking into account thermodiffusion. The impact of oxygen redistribution during a power transient on irradiated fuel thermochemistry in the fuel and on chemically reactive gas release from the fuel (I(g), I2(g), CsI(g), TeI2(g), Cs(g), Cs2(g)) is studied. The simulations show that oxygen redistribution, even if moderate in magnitude, leads to the reduction of metallic oxides (molybdenum dioxide, cesium molybdates, chromium oxide) at the fuel pellet center and consequently to the release of a much greater quantity of gaseous cesium. Pellet-Cladding Interaction failure propensity is shown to decrease in consequence of the thermodynamically favourable reaction of iodine with released cesium in the free volume of the rod.},

Operating conditions such as high temperatures, irradiation and a corrosive environment degrade materials properties, posing the risk of very expensive or even catastrophic plant damage. Materials scientists are faced with the scientific challenge to determine the long-term damage evolution of materials under service exposure in advanced plants. A higher confidence in life-time assessments of these materials requires an understanding of the related physical phenomena on a range of scales from the microscopic level of single defect damage effects all the way up to macroscopic effects. To overcome lengthy and expensive trial-and-error experiments, the multiscale modelling of materials behaviour is a promising tool, bringing new insights into the fundamental understanding of basic mechanisms. This paper presents the multiscale modelling methodology which is taking root internationally to address the issues of advanced structural materials for Gen IV reactors.},

	abstract = {This study proposes an approach for capturing the effect of microstructural evolution on reactor fuel performance by coupling a mesoscale irradiated microstructure model with a finite element fuel performance code. To achieve this, the macroscale system is solved in a parallel, fully coupled, fully-implicit manner using the preconditioned Jacobian-free Newton Krylov (JFNK) method. Within the JFNK solution algorithm, microstructure-influenced material parameters are calculated by the mesoscale model and passed back to the macroscale calculation. Due to the stochastic nature of the mesoscale model, a dynamic fitting technique is implemented to smooth roughness in the calculated material parameters. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on a simple model of a reactor fuel pellet. In the model, INL's BISON fuel performance code calculates the steady-state temperature profile in a fuel pellet and the microstructure-influenced thermal conductivity is determined with a phase field model of irradiated microstructures. This simple multiscale model demonstrates good nonlinear convergence and near ideal parallel scalability. By capturing the formation of large mesoscale voids in the pellet interior, the multiscale model predicted the irradiation-induced reduction in the thermal conductivity commonly observed in reactors.},

	abstract = {Nuclear fuel operates in an environment that induces complex multiphysics phenomena, occurring over distances ranging from inter-atomic spacing to meters, and times scales ranging from microseconds to years. This multiphysics behavior is often tightly coupled and many important aspects are inherently multidimensional. Most current fuel modeling codes employ loose multiphysics coupling and are restricted to 2D axisymmetric or 1.5D approximations. This paper describes a new modeling tool able to simulate coupled multiphysics and multiscale fuel behavior, for either 2D axisymmetric or 3D geometries. Specific fuel analysis capabilities currently implemented in this tool are described, followed by a set of demonstration problems which include a 10-pellet light water reactor fuel rodlet, three-dimensional analysis of pellet clad mechanical interaction in the vicinity of a defective fuel pellet, coupled heat transfer and fission product diffusion in a TRISO-coated fuel particle, a demonstration of the ability to couple to lower-length scale models to account for material property variation with microstructural evolution, and a demonstration of the tool's ability to efficiently solve very large and complex problems using massively-parallel computing. A final section describes an early validation exercise, comparing simulation results to a light water reactor fuel rod experiment.},

	abstract = {Computation of phase equilibrium is a very important and frequently encountered problem in process systems engineering. Accurate and robust flash routines are at the core of the major part of chemical engineering design applications, ranging from pipelines to distillation columns, chemical reactors, and oil and gas production. The multiphase equilibrium calculation by the direct minimization of the Gibbs free energy has some potential advantages over classical methods, mainly because the equality of chemical potentials is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for equilibrium. Recent developments in global optimization and the availability of very fast computers have stimulated the research on the direct minimization approach. In this work, a hybrid method (genetic algorithm for the global search and interior point for refinement) was implemented and the efficiency/reliability relation was studied. For some systems the global minimum can be found in a NFE compatible with the methods currently available in process simulators. But, it was also found that, for some systems, there is an asymptotic behavior. Apparently, a reliability of 100 %, when using global search algorithms with some random nature, would be found only for an infinite number of function evaluations.},

This stochastic optimization method is used to robustly solve a system of non-linear equations that results from the equalities of the orthogonal derivatives of the Gibbs energy and the Gibbs energy of mixing in the vapor and the liquid phases. For non-reactive systems, this equation system is solved by considering conventional composition variables while for reactive cases we use the transformed composition variables proposed by Ung and Doherty. Numerical performance of our approach is illustrated using several examples previously reported in the literature and results show that it is a suitable and robust strategy for the calculation of homogeneous azeotropes in mixtures with or without chemical reactions.},

	abstract = {Phase equilibrium modeling plays an important role in design, optimization and control of separation processes. The global optimization problem involved in phase equilibrium calculations is very challenging due to the high non-linearity of thermodynamic models especially for multi-component systems subject to chemical reactions. To date, a few attempts have been made in the application of stochastic methods for reactive phase equilibrium calculations compared to those reported for non-reactive systems. In particular, the population-based stochastic methods are known for their good exploration abilities and, when optimal balance between the exploration and exploitation is found, they can be reliable and efficient global optimizers. Genetic algorithms (GAs) and differential evolution with tabu list (DETL) have been very successful for performing phase equilibrium calculations in non-reactive systems. However, there are no previous studies on the performance of both these strategies to solve the Gibbs free energy minimization problem for systems subject to chemical equilibrium. In this study, the constrained and unconstrained Gibbs free energy minimization in reactive systems have been analyzed and used to assess the performance of GA and DETL. Specifically, the numerical performance of these stochastic methods have been tested using both conventional and transformed composition variables as the decision vector for free energy minimization in reactive systems, and their relative strengths are discussed. The results of these strategies are compared with those obtained using SA, which has shown competitive performance in reactive phase equilibrium calculations. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies in the literature on the comparison of reactive phase equilibrium using both the formulations with stochastic global optimization methods. Our results show that the effectiveness of the stochastic methods tested depends on the stopping criterion, the type of decision variables, and the use of local optimization for intensification stage. Overall, unconstrained Gibbs free energy minimization involving transformed composition variables requires more computational time compared to constrained minimization, and DETL has better performance for both constrained and unconstrained Gibbs free energy minimization in reactive systems.},

A local optimization technique is used at the end of both TS and DE to improve the accuracy of the final solution. Benchmark problems involve 2--20 variables with a few to hundreds of local minima whereas PEC and PS problems consist of multiple components with comparable minima. PEC involves both vapor--liquid, liquid--liquid and vapor--liquid--liquid equilibria with popular thermodynamic models.

	abstract = {An enhanced simulated annealing algorithm (SAA) is presented to verify the phase stability analysis and obtain the true solution of the phase equilibrium problem of multi-component systems at high pressures. Using the enhanced SAA, the global stability analysis is checked on the basis of the minimization results of the tangent plane distance functions (TPDF) for the systems where the nonideal phases are described by PR or SRK equations of state. The consequent phase equilibrium calculation is accomplished by the Newton--Raphson method based upon the stability analysis results. The calculation results for three systems including ternary, quaternary, and five-component mixtures that exhibit multiple immiscibility gaps with different charges at elevated pressures state that the combined algorithm can effectively locate the global minima of these systems involving symmetric models, then the final stability analysis implemented is used to ensure the global minimization. In comparison with MULPRG and HOMPEQ developed by Michelsen and Sun and Seider (1995, Fluid phase Equilibrium, 103, 213--249) respectively, the enhanced SAA is slightly slower and provides comparable reliability, but it is self-starting.},

	abstract = {The determination of the correct number of equilibrium phases and their corresponding compositions at fixed temperature and pressure (TP flash) is studied. The novel aspects of this work center around unique initialization strategies and successive quadratic programming (SQP) enhancements that include the use of (1) only binary tangent plane analyses; (2) the determination of all partially miscible binary pairs and a dominant immiscible pair; (3) novel relative solubility calculations based on component activities and double tangency separation; (4) least squares solutions to compute phase fraction estimates; (5) a variety of algorithmic features that dynamically trap difficulties such as compositions well below machine accuracy, and trivial and collapsed solutions and (6) a posteriori testing of phase and solution stability. The overall algorithmic framework is one based on using a combination of binary tangent plane analyses, bubble point calculations and dimensionless Gibbs free energy minimizations. Binary tangent plane analyses are used to identify all immiscible or partially miscible binary pairs and to avoid dimensionality difficulties associated with locating all stationary points in the tangent plane distance function in the full composition space. The proposed approach consists of solving a sequence of subproblems (i.e. LE, LLE, VLLE,{\ldots}) until the global minimum dimensionless Gibbs free energy (G/RT) is found. Maximum information from binary tangent plane analyses and previously solved subproblems are used to generate initial values for the next subproblem. The concept of relative solubilities is introduced and used to initialize phase compositions in all LLE calculations (i.e. phase split or flash). All completely miscible component relative solubilities are calculated using component activities while those for immiscible or partially miscible components are initialized using double tangency separation. Phase fractions are initialized using a least-square solution to the set of component mass balances. All subproblems are formulated in terms of component flows and solved using a full space SQP method using a modified Broyden--Fletcher--Goldfarb--Shanno (BFGS) update of the Lagrangian Hessian matrix. The proposed algorithm was tested within the Aspen Plus process simulator using a variety of physical properties options. Twenty six multicomponent mixtures including some four-phase (VLLLE) emulsion polymerization problems were used to test the proposed algorithm. All problems were easily solved and clearly demonstrate the capabilities of the present multiphase TP flash model.},

	abstract = {Abstract
A reliable algorithm for the solution of fluid phase equilibrium at constant pressure and temperature (P, T flash) is presented. The approach is applicable to multi-component mixtures described with general equations of state and is based on a formulation of P, T phase equilibrium as a dual optimisation problem in volume-composition space, translated away from the Gibbs free energy to the Helmholtz free energy. This formulation facilitates the use of guaranteed solution algorithms, particularly in the case of sophisticated equations of state (EOSs) such as SAFT (statistical associating fluid theory), because such representations are higher-than-cubic functions in volume and are formulated in the Helmholtz free energy. With the proposed algorithm (which is based on a combination of local and global optimisation, where the number of subproblems to be solved globally is kept at a minimum) one is guaranteed to identify the number of stable phases present at equilibrium, along with their properties, without any need for initial guesses, or indeed any a priori knowledge about the behaviour of the system. The method is applicable to the calculation of any kind of fluid phase behaviour (e.g., vapour--liquid (VLE), liquid--liquid (LLE), vapour--liquid--liquid (VLLE), etc.). Several algorithmic options are investigated and their computational performance compared. A prototype implementation is used to determine the fluid phase equilibria of a number of binary and ternary systems, where the thermodynamic properties are calculated through a molecular-based EOS. Examples are shown for the VLE and VLLE for mixtures modelled with an augmented van der Waals EOS, a non-cubic EOS that incorporates the Carnahan and Starling representation of the repulsive interactions. Further examples are presented for VLE and VLLE in polymer systems, modelled with an EOS of the generic SAFT form. Fluid phase equilibrium calculations for polymer systems are notoriously difficult, and convergence problems are often encountered, even with good initial guesses. The proposed method is found to be reliable in all cases examined.},

Equilibrium at constant P and T was found by minimization of G, while equilibrium at constant P and H was found by maximization of S or minimization of −S, all with respect to the number of moles of each component in each phase. Both cases could be handled as optimization problems, satisfying the restrictions imposed by mole or atom balances, and non-negativity of number of moles. Convexity analyses were carried out, and the conditions were found in order to guarantee global minimum, for one liquid phase, one gas phase, and a number of solid phases. The minimum point was then found either by analytical methods or by direct minimization methods. These strategies were tested for a number of cases, with good results.},

In this work, a new procedure involving the continuation method in the complex domain using bifurcation theory is propounded. Based on this method, homotopy branches in real and complex space are connected to each other through bifurcation branches. Thus, by just one initial guess, multiple solution branches are found. When calculations are only made in the real domain, multiple solutions are not always found from an arbitrary initial guess. Examples are presented to show the application of the method to nonlinear sets of equations in phase equilibrium, chemical and phase equilibrium, and stability analysis.

	abstract = {Phase equilibrium calculations are often involved in the design, simulation, and optimization of chemical processes. Reported methods for these calculations are based on either equation-solving or Gibbs free energy minimization approaches. The main objective of this work is to compare selected methods for these two approaches, in terms of reliability to find the correct solution, computational time, and number of K-value evaluations. For this, four equation-solving and three free minimization methods have been selected and applied to commonly encountered vapour--liquid equilibrium (VLE), liquid--liquid equilibrium (LLE), and vapour--liquid--liquid equilibrium (VLLE) examples involving multiple components and popular thermodynamic models. Detailed results show that the equation-solving method based on the Rachford--Rice formulation accompanied by mean value theorem and Wegstein's projection is reliable and efficient for two-phase equilibrium calculations not having local minima. When there are multiple minima and for three-phase equilibrium, the stochastic method, genetic algorithm (GA) followed by modified simplex method of Nelder and Mead (NM) is more reliable and desirable. Generic programs for numerical methods are ineffective for phase equilibrium calculations. These findings are of interest and value to researchers and engineers working on phase equilibrium calculations and/or developing thermodynamic models for phase behaviour.},

The method is a steepest descent search for the minimum of the free energy of the system. It makes no assumptions regarding reactions taking place between the various species in the system, nor is there a limit to the number of solid species that can be included in the search. The only information necessary is the free energy as a function of temperature of all species that can be present under the given conditions. The method is particularly useful for calculations on small sized computers, such as the Bendix G-15-D for which it has been programmed. It has been found to have several advantages over published methods(1, 3). The searching method described can also be used for a variety of other problems, e.g. computation of changes in equilibrium composition with temperature.},

	abstract = {The Gibbs energy minimization encompasses active use of the chemical potentials (partial molar Gibbs energies) of the constituents of the system. Usually, these appear at their equilibrium values as a result of the minimization calculation, the mass balance constraints being the necessary subsidiary conditions. Yet, there are several such physico-chemical circumstances where the system is also constrained by other factors, such as surface effects, potential fields or even by chemical reaction kinetics. In this paper a particular method is presented by which constrained chemical potentials can be applied in a multi-phase Gibbs energy minimization. The constrained potentials arise typically from work-related thermodynamic displacements in the system. When Gibbs energy minimization is performed by the Lagrange method, these constraints appear as additional Lagrangian multipliers. Examples of the constrained potential method are presented in terms of the electrochemical Donnan equilibria in aqueous systems containing semi-permeable interfaces, the phase formation in surface-energy controlled systems and in systems with affinities controlled by chemical reaction kinetics. The methods have been applied successfully in calculating distribution coefficients for metal ions together with pH-values in pulp suspensions, in the calculation of surface tension of alloys, and in thermochemical process modeling involving chemical reaction rates.},

	abstract = {Computation of chemical equilibria in multiphase systems by Gibbs free energy minimization under constraints set by the material balance has increasing interest in many application fields, including materials technology, metallurgy and chemical engineering. The results are utilised in multi-phase equilibrium studies or as parts of equilibrium-based process simulation. Yet, there exist a number of practical problems where the chemical system is influenced by other constraining factors such as surface energy or electrochemical charge transport. For such systems, an extended Gibbs energy method has been applied. In the new method, the potential energy is introduced to the Gibbs energy calculation as a Legendre transformed work term divided into substance specific contributions. The additional constraint potential is then represented by a supplementary undertermined Lagrange multiplier. In addition, upper bounds on the amounts of products can be set, which then limit the maximum extents of selected spontaneous chemical reactions in terms of affinity. The range of Gibbs energy calculations can then be extended to new intricate systems. Example models based on free energy minimisation have been made e.g. for surface and interfacial systems, where the surface, interfacial or adsorbed atomic or molecular layers are modeled as separate phases. In an analogous fashion the partitioning effect of a semi-permeable membrane in a two-compartment aqueous system can be modeled. In such system the large ions, not permeable through the membrane, cause an uneven charge distribution of ionic species between the two compartments. In this case, the electrochemical potential difference between the two aqueous phases becomes calculated for the multi-component system. The calculated results are consistent with the Donnan equilibrium theory; however the multi-phase system may also include the gas phase and several precipitating phases, which extends the applicability of the new method. Finally, similar constraints can also be set to extents of reaction advancements, allowing usage of Gibbs energy calculations in dynamic reaction rate controlled systems.},

	abstract = {We have revised the thermodynamic database MALT to match the window's environments and also to make it bilingual (English and Japanese). The main characteristic features are described with an emphasis on those functions which will be available in the new version. To facilitate the application of thermodynamic analysis on materials development and process analysis, the database MALT provides generalized programs for calculating chemical equilibria and constructing chemical potential diagrams. MALT encourages users to utilize thermodynamic data in the databases as well as their own in thermodynamic analysis on their own materials/processes problems. To facilitate it, MALT provides the function called ``MALT Direct,'' which can make access to the data users prepare, and can utilize them in their own programs written in Pascal and compiled in Delphi. Some functions of the generalized calculation programs, gem and CHD, are also described in this report.},

	abstract = {A new method for the calculation of simultaneous chemical and phase equilibria at specified temperature and pressure is presented. An algorithm previously proposed for isothermal multiphase flash problems is extended and modified for systems with reversible chemical reactions. A method for the automatic selection of independent chemical reactions is improved and extended to nonideal mixtures. The iterative calculations are initialized with an accelerated direct substitution procedure. A second-order minimization algorithm is utilized for the final iterations. The differential phase stability test is applied to verify the need for adding new phases to the system. Phase removal is tried even for two-phase systems whereas, in flash problems without reaction, phase removal only needs to be attempted for systems with three or more phases. Examples that illustrate the performance of the method for mixtures with nonideal phases are presented.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the coupling of the fuel performance code ALCYONE with the thermochemical code ANGE and its application to Iodine-Stress Corrosion Cracking (I-SCC). The coupling is illustrated by a 3D simulation of a power ramp. The release of chemically active gases (CsI(g), Tex(1<x<7)(g), TeI2(g), I(g), I2(g){\ldots}) is studied. The calculated radial distributions of iodine, cesium, tellurium and inert fission gas in the pellet fragment before and after the power ramp are successfully compared to Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) measurements. Based on the 3D simulation, the definition of a stress corrosion initiation criterion is discussed. The combination of the hoop stress and of the quantity of reactive iodine (I(g), I2(g) and TeI2(g) only) released by the pellet is used to show that the necessary conditions for Pellet Cladding Interaction-Stress Corrosion Cracking (PCI-SCC) initiation, based on out-of-pile I-SCC laboratory tests criteria, are met during the simulated power transient.},

	abstract = {The present study describes the full thermodynamic assessment of the Li,Cs,Th//F,I system. The existing database for the relevant fluoride salts considered as fuel for the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) has been extended with two key fission products, cesium and iodine. A complete evaluation of all the common-ion binary and ternary sub-systems of the LiF-ThF4-CsF-LiI-ThI4-CsI system has been performed and the optimized parameters are presented in this work. New equilibrium data have been measured using Differential Scanning Calorimetry and were used to assess the reciprocal ternary systems and confirm the extrapolated phase diagrams. The developed database significantly contributes to the understanding of the behaviour of cesium and iodine in the MSR, which strongly depends on their concentration and chemical form. Cesium bonded with fluorine is well retained in the fuel mixture while in the form of CsI the solubility of these elements is very limited. Finally, the influence of CsI and CsF on the physico-chemical properties of the fuel mixture was calculated as function of composition.},

	abstract = {Abstract Effective initial sampling plays an important role in capturing key details about the energy surfaces of multi-component, multi-sublattice phases for the purposes of accurate convergence toward the global minimum energy configuration of a given system. It is shown that, when using the appropriate statistical distribution, both quasi-random and pseudo-random sampling methods compare well with the standard uniform grid-based technique. Moreover, the combination of random sampling with uniform grid points, while maintaining sampling performance for equilibrium calculations in the Al-Co-Cr system, significantly increases performance for a fictive 10-component system. },
